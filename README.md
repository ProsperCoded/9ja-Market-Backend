- **Efficiency**: Optimizing performance to provide a fast and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Primary runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality.
- **Prisma**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: For secure password hashing.
- **EventEmitter**: For handling asynchronous events.
- **Winston**: A logging library for managing logs.
- **Postman**: For API testing and documentation.
